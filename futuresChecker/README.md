# How Does It Work?

This JavaScript code is designed for real-time trade manipulation detection. It monitors BTC trade data from the Binance WebSocket, identifies potential manipulation attempts within blocks of trades, and categorizes them by importance. The system also tracks the biggest trades and maintains a log of significant trade events. It's a useful tool for cryptocurrency traders and analysts to monitor and react to potentially suspicious trading activity.
