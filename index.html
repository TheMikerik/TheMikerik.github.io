            <h3>Student at VSB-FEI (Computer Sience)</h3>
            <p> I am a 20-year-old college student studying computer science.
                Since September 2022, I have been diving into the world of
                programming, constantly expanding my skills and knowledge.
                My passion lies in trading bots, machine learning, and
                application development, as I am fascinated by their potential
                to revolutionize various industries. With each passing day,
                I am driven to explore and create innovative solutions that 
                merge technology and real-world applications.</p>
